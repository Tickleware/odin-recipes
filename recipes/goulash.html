        In order to make Goulash you will need the following ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>Macaroni Noodles</li>
            <li>1 Stick of Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>1lb of Meat (most used is gound beef, but I prefer maple sausage)</li>
            <li>Tablespoon of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder</li>
            <li>Worcester Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will first boil the noodles. Set the temperature on the oven to med-high and then fill a pot with water (make sure it is not too full,
        only to the top of the noodles you will be putting in later) and put the pot on the stove-top. While the water is coming to a boil, put all
        the meat and seasonings into a bowl and mix. When you are done mixing the pot of water should now be at a boil, add the macaroni and stir often to
        make sure the noodles do not stick to the bottom of the pot. When the noodles are done cooking, drain the water by using a large strainer to catch all
        the noodles and leaving the water to fall into the sink.
        </p>

        <p>While the water is draining from the strainer, put the meat into the pot that is on the stove-top. Cook until golden brown and then turn down the heat 
            to med-low. If there is excess grease from the meat, drain it into the sink, but be careful not to drain it on top of your noodles. Finally, you can add
            your noodles to the meat in the pan. Add around a tablespoon of butter to the noodles and meat so they are not sticking to each other. 
        </p>

        <p>After you have combined the meat and noodles, add the creamcheese for thickness and flavoring. Stir until the creamcheese is evenly distrbuted and then
            add ketchup and taste test constantly to ensure you have enough ketchup for a good taste, but is not overwhelming. Add around a tablespoon of Worcester
            sauce for some more flavoring and then stir to evenly distrbute. Add a garnish of parsely on top and you are officially done!
