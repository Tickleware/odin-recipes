        <p>A straightforward way to a delicious desert is to make yourself some Nutella Croissants! Nutella Croissants
            are a simple desert made from 3 simple ingredients! (unless you plan on making the croissants from scratch).
        </p>
        <p>All you need is the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake Ready Croissants</li>
            <li>Nutella</li>
            <li>Butter (for the golden brown crispy croissants)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make this desert, you'll need to layout the unbaked croissants, and spread nutella in the middle of them using a butterknife.
            Be careful not to add to much or you'll have some nutella running out of the croissants in the baking phase. Roll the 
            croissants up and place them evenly on a baking sheet pan. Bake for <strong>10-15 mins</strong> at <strong>375 Degrees</strong> or until golden brown on top.
        </p>
        <p>There you have it! An easy to make and easier to enjoy desert!</p>
